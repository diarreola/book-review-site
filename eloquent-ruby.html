<!-- Create a book review page for the book Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen in a new file eloquent-ruby.html. The content for that page is provided in the content folder by the text file eloquent-ruby.txt. The book review page should have the same overall structure as index.html, except the main content section should structure the information inside of the text file. The page should also include the image of the book, included in the images folder.

Use eloquent-ruby.html as a template for the other review pages for the other books. -->
